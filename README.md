🤖 AI Personal Assistant — Cross-Platform Desktop Tool
📌 Project Overview
This project is a cross-platform AI-powered personal assistant that allows the user to perform complex tasks on their computer through natural language, via voice input or a hotkey trigger (Alt+Space).

Example command:

“Go to amazon.com and search for HyperX101 mouse and place the order to my home using cash on delivery.”

The assistant interprets the command using AI and automates browser/system interactions — all securely, quickly, and smoothly, with no antivirus/firewall issues.

✨ Key Features

## 3. **Security & Privacy Best Practices**

- **No keylogging, no background network sockets.**
- **Manual login only for sensitive sites (e.g., Amazon).**
- **No credential storage.**
- **On-demand activation only (hotkey/voice).**
- **Code signing for packaged apps (optional, for distribution).**

---

## 4. **Performance & UX**

- **Lazy loading**: Only load heavy modules (Playwright, Whisper) when needed.
- **Threaded execution**: All blocking tasks run in background threads.
- **Minimal UI**: Tkinter popup is fast, always-on-top, and non-intrusive.
- **Resource monitoring**: Use `psutil` to avoid high CPU/RAM usage.

---

## 5. **Development & Packaging**

- **Dev Environment**:  
  - Use `venv` for isolation.
  - Use Cursor IDE for AI-powered coding.
- **Packaging**:  
  - Windows: `pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed main.py`
  - macOS: `py2app`
- **Testing**:  
  - Manual and automated tests for each module.
  - Use `pytest` for unit tests (optional).

---

## 8. **Professional Recommendations**

- **Version Pinning:** Always use pinned versions in `requirements.txt` for reproducibility.
- **Virtual Environments:** Use `venv` or `conda` for isolation.
- **Code Quality:** Use `black` and `flake8` for formatting/linting.
- **Documentation:** Maintain a clear `README.md` and inline code comments.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests for each module as you go.
- **Security:** Never store or transmit sensitive data. Always prompt for manual login.
