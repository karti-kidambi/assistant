🤖 AI Personal Assistant — Cross-Platform Desktop Tool
📌 Project Overview
This project is a cross-platform AI-powered personal assistant that allows the user to perform complex tasks on their computer through natural language, via voice input or a hotkey trigger (Alt+Space).

Example command:

“Go to amazon.com and search for HyperX101 mouse and place the order to my home using cash on delivery.”

The assistant interprets the command using AI and automates browser/system interactions — all securely, quickly, and smoothly, with no antivirus/firewall issues.

✨ Key Features
Feature	Description
🧠 Natural Language Understanding	Understand and extract user intent from typed/spoken commands
🎤 Voice Activation	Start tasks using voice commands via your microphone
⌨️ Hotkey Trigger	Press Alt+Space to instantly launch the assistant input window
🌐 Browser Automation	Automate browsing, shopping, and form-filling with Playwright
🖱️ Desktop Automation	Simulate mouse, keyboard, and app control (open/click/type)
💻 System Commands	Control volume, brightness, open/close apps, and more
📦 Cross-Platform Builds	Clean .exe (Windows) and .app (macOS) files
🧠 Cursor IDE Support	Developed and managed inside the AI-powered Cursor editor

🧱 Modular Architecture
No.	Module	Purpose
1	🔑 Hotkey Listener + UI	Show assistant when Alt+Space is pressed
2	🎤 Voice-to-Text Engine	Convert speech to command (uses Google STT or Whisper)
3	🧠 NLP Interpreter	Parse command to intent → action (using regex or OpenAI GPT)
4	🌐 Browser Controller	Automate Chrome-based tasks via Playwright
5	🖥️ Desktop Controller	Use pyautogui for desktop clicks, keystrokes, windows
6	⚙️ System Commands	OS-level controls like volume, open apps
7	🔁 Thread Management	Non-blocking multi-tasking to keep system smooth
8	🧩 UI / Input Box	Tkinter-based sleek popup for typed commands
9	📦 Packaging	Create .exe (Windows) / .app (macOS) with PyInstaller or Tauri (optional)

🛠️ Tools, Technologies & Stack
Layer	Tool/Tech	Purpose
Language	Python 3.11+	Core language
IDE	Cursor	AI-powered VS Code IDE with inline suggestions
UI	Tkinter	Minimal popup for input
Hotkey	keyboard	Global shortcut listener
Voice	SpeechRecognition + PyAudio / Whisper	Converts voice to text
NLP	Rule-based parser + optional OpenAI GPT API	Command interpretation
Browser Automation	Playwright	Headless/full browser control
Desktop Control	pyautogui, pygetwindow	Click, type, window control
Threads	Python threading	Fast, responsive execution
Packaging	PyInstaller / py2app	Compile to .exe and .app
Security	None invasive	No keylogging, sockets, or hidden scripts

⚙️ Performance Optimization
Strategy	Description
🚀 Lazy Module Loading	Load Playwright/Whisper only when used
🧵 Background Threads	All modules run non-blocking
🧼 Minimal UI	Tkinter is lightweight and fast
👁️ Headless Mode	Faster browser automation
🧠 Configurable Modes	Disable voice/NLP to use "quick match" only
📊 Optional Monitoring	Use psutil to auto-pause heavy usage modules

Result: Fast, clean, responsive even on 4GB RAM systems.

💻 System Requirements
Resource	Requirement
RAM	4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended)
CPU	Dual-core+ (Intel i5 or Ryzen 3 and up)
Disk	SSD recommended
OS	Windows 10+ or macOS 11+
Python	Version 3.11+
Mic	Optional for voice control

📦 Building for Distribution
Windows:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed main.py
macOS:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install py2app
python setup.py py2app
Tauri (Optional UI Framework):
For future beautiful UI: https://tauri.app — use Rust + TypeScript frontend.

🧑‍💻 How to Use Cursor for This Project
✅ Install Cursor from https://www.cursor.so

✅ Open the project directory in Cursor

✅ Use built-in terminal to create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
✅ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
✅ Use Cursor AI suggestions to build faster

✅ Use Cursor Git tools for version control

🧾 Sample Commands It Can Handle
“Search iPhone 15 on Flipkart”

“Open calculator”

“Mute volume”

“Go to amazon.com, search gaming mouse, place order”

“Play lo-fi playlist on YouTube”

🛡️ Security & Privacy
Concern	Our Approach
🔐 No Keyloggers	No background logging of keystrokes
❌ No Hidden Servers	No external socket or port opened
🔒 On-demand Activation	Listens only when activated via hotkey or voice
🛑 Antivirus-safe	No scripts or behaviors that trigger Windows Defender
🔁 Manual Login Only	For shopping tasks, you must login yourself (no password storage)
